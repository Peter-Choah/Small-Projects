Bank Data Analysis assignment done in a group of 5.

A short data exploration was done to get an overview of the characteristics of clients that subscribe to bank deposits.

Later, we use machine learning to produce a model that predicts the clients that would subscribe to the bank term deposit.

We used kNN, stepwise regression, decision tree, random forest and picked the best model in terms of accuracy on the sample set.
