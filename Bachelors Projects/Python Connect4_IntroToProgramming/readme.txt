This is a student project that I've done on the first Python programming semester back in 2019.

The code runs the game Connect4 in Python.

It has 3 gamemodes, the basic connect 4, connect 5, and special mode.

Special mode consist of two player playing against each other and a bot to disrupt the map.
If the board fills up in this mode, all the bot tokens are removed.

The bot uses simple RNG to determine where to place their token.
